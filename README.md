Archived: clickhouse "as logs storage" stream viewer 🌊🏄🏽‍♀️

Prototype of stream viewer based on golang backend and vue frontend. The main motivation is using clickhouse as logs storage and has some nice ui like Graylog to display logs stream and realtime + ability to do some queries on simple language (impl based on PEG grammars).

Currently archived, because using clickhouse as lightweight and small logs storage is looks heavy.
