Archived: clickhouse "as logs storage" stream viewer 🌊🏄🏽‍♀️

Prototype of stream viewer based on golang backend and vue frontend. The main motivation is using clickhouse as logs storage and has some nice ui like Graylog to display logs stream in realtime + ability to do some queries on simple language (implementation bases on PEG parser).

Currently archived, because using clickhouse as lightweight and small logs storage is looks heavy.
